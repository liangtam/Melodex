# Melodex
Melodex is a music management website where the user can CRUD music artists and discography, as well as look for their favourite artists. They can also dynamically filter an artist's attributes, such as only showing the artists' names, etc.
The project was created with two other peers for an academic project. We designed (and normalized) the relation schema, chose the tech stack (React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Spring Boot/Java), and implemented the entire project on our own without template code.

The front-end code is in the main branch while the back-end code is in the master branch.
